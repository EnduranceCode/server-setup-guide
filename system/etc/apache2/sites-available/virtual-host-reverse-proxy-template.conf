<VirtualHost *:80>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

	# Replace the label {VIRTUAL_HOST_FOLDER} with the desired domain name
	# and replace {VIRTUAL_HOST_TLD} with the correct TLD
	ServerName {VIRTUAL_HOST_FOLDER}.{VIRTUAL_HOST_TLD}

	# Replace the label {VIRTUAL_HOST_FOLDER} with the desired domain name
	ServerAlias www.{VIRTUAL_HOST_FOLDER}.{VIRTUAL_HOST_TLD}

	# Replace the label {SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL} with the server's admin e-mail
	ServerAdmin {SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL}

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,

	LogLevel info

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
