# Server setup guide

## Introduction

This is my personal guide to setup an Ubuntu server. To build this guide I've used the knowledge available on the internet and the sources are, as much as possible, linked on this guide.

I will be updating this guide as my knowledge and experience evolves. I will be glad to take advice, suggestions and/or [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
